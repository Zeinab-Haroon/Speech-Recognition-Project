# Speech_recognition_project in Arabic Language
## Taught by Gabriel, Neil, Emmanuel and Laurent Besacier.

The project aims to build small Automatic Speech Recognition in high resource language (Arabic).
Linear layers were trained on top of pre-trained contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and it was fined tuned with connection temporal classification (CTC). As a result, the Character error rate (CER) and the Phone error rate (PER) for both the train and test Dataset have been computed.

## Data Collection:
The Data contains two hours recording sets that was collected using LIG-Aikuma application in Arabic Language. The Data has been split into train, test and validation set as followed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item train : training set wav files- 40 mins
	\item val : validation set- 20 mins
	\item test: test set- one hour
\end{itemize}
